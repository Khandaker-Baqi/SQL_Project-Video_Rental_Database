## Formulation of launch strategy for a new online video rental service to be launched by a fictional movie rental company (Rockbuster Stealth LLC)
Rockbuster Stealth LLC (fictional organization) is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team were planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board had asked a series of business questions and they were expecting data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they had asked:
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
I queried and analysed the Rockbuster dataset (http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip) which contains information about Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, payments etc. PostgreSQL was used for querying the dataset and Microsoft Excel and Tableau were used for the analysis and visualizations.
The final report included specific findings and recommendations relevant to the stakeholders' questions and it was published in Tableau public: https://public.tableau.com/views/RockbusterStealth_16483437372160/RockbusterStealth?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
